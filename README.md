# üß¨ Skin Disorder Prediction

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts different types of skin disorders based on patient symptoms and clinical features. Early detection of skin diseases is crucial for timely treatment and management.

## üéØ Objective

To classify and predict skin disorders using machine learning algorithms and a labeled dataset of dermatological conditions.

---

## üìä Dataset Features (Example)

- Itching  
- Scaling  
- Redness  
- Swelling  
- Burning Sensation  
- Skin Thickness  
- Spot Appearance  
- Family History  
- Target: Skin Disorder Type (e.g., Psoriasis, Eczema, Dermatitis)

> Note: Actual features depend on the dataset used.

## üîç Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Loaded skin disease dataset (e.g., `skin_disorders.csv`)

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Normalizing/standardizing data

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing distributions
   - Checking class imbalance
   - Correlation analysis

4. **Model Building**
   - Classification algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost
   - Train-test split and cross-validation

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - Confusion Matrix

6. **Model Export**
   - Saved final model as `skin_disorder_model.pkl`
